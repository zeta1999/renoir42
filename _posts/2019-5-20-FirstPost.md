Dear all, I am currently building this github portfolio. This will mostly cover functional programming and math programming, so a mix of, say, OCaml and C++ as well as other tools.

I will not be able to cover all technologies at once but please stay tuned as I most likely already have some experience with the solution you want.

*please stay tuned*
